Description: multi-protocol port-knocking discovery tool
 Knockraven brute forces port‑knocking sequences to find hidden services.
 This command‑line utility can test arbitrary TCP, UDP or mixed sequences
 against a host and monitor a port to see if the hidden service becomes
 available.  It is designed for security auditors and penetration testers
 who need to verify whether port‑knocking is deployed on a network.  Only
 use it with permission from the system owner.
